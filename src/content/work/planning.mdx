# The product
Praxedo, created in 2005, is a comprehensive Field Resource Management solution designed to streamline the end-to-end workflow of service interventions. The platform empowers office teams to efficiently plan and assign technician jobs, while equipping field technicians with guided workflows, real-time updates, and mobile tools to ensure seamless service delivery. By bridging office operations and on-the-ground execution, Praxedo enhances operational efficiency, reduces response times, and improves customer satisfaction.

Our client base spanned multiple segments, with telecommunications emerging as the primary industry. Additionally, we served sectors like sanitation, among others. Given the solution’s versatility as a feature-rich, off-the-shelf product, our diverse client portfolio introduced a unique challenge: understanding and addressing the varying needs and workflows of different user groups across industries.

# The story

Sales teams identified that the lack of adapted features in our planning solution was a major source of frustration for clients, particularly those with more complex planning needs, such as those in the sanitation sector. These clients struggled with inefficiencies and wasted time, as the solution didn't offer the necessary tools to manage resources or visualize team collaboration effectively. This led to frustration, inefficiency, and an increased risk of churn.

Faced with the challenge of preventing churn while expanding our client base in the sanitation industry, we recognized that the solution’s lack of utility was a key barrier to both retention and growth. We identified the need for a new feature to address these gaps—improving resource visualization, streamlining team management, and ultimately enhancing client satisfaction.

To tackle this, we gathered deep insights into user needs through interviews and feedback, enabling us to better understand the underlying issues and functional gaps between our solution and their requirements. With this understanding in hand, we were able to launch the initiative.

# My role

As the Product Manager, I led the delivery of this large-scale technical and functional initiative. 

### Discovery Phase: Understanding User Needs and Prioritizing Solutions

In the Discovery phase, I worked closely with the UX team to define user needs, prioritize features, and design initial solutions. I led user interviews and observed real-world usage to uncover critical pain points, such as the inability to visualize and manage dynamic teams effectively. We discovered that users were manually using Excel, which created significant inefficiencies.

I synthesized these insights, leading ideation sessions with UX and development teams to explore feasible solutions. We prioritized visualizing teams and resources as an immediate solution that would improve the user experience, reducing reliance on external documents. This quick win aligned with business objectives and set the stage for further development.

### Delivery Phase: Executing the Solution

After solidifying our priorities, I collaborated with technical teams to define the solution’s architecture and resolve any challenges related to scalability and performance. I managed the product backlog, maintained strong communication with stakeholders, and refined the feature in real-time based on user feedback. We delivered quick wins, like improving team visualization, and also incorporated features to manage urgent situations.

# Results

Working on this feature brought significant improvements to the product, its market desirability, and the internal organization of our team.

### Product and Market Impact
 
Introducing this feature opened new commercial opportunities, particularly with clients who had previously declined our solution due to a lack of visibility in team management. This enhancement was a decisive factor in securing contracts with three additional clients. Furthermore, the feature garnered widespread adoption, with more than 1,500 users identified.

### Organizational Growth

The development of this feature also drove valuable organizational improvements. Implementing a new technology (React) required the development team to adapt its workflows, including revising how user stories were structured and defining prerequisite technical tasks. Additionally, collaboration between project managers and product managers improved significantly, ensuring relevant information was effectively communicated.

These learnings led to the creation of enhanced documentation and communication practices, which proved efficient enough to be adopted across other projects, contributing to lasting organizational benefits.

# Challenges and learnings

Here are some key learnings we established during this initiative:

### Set Small Hypotheses Before Testing Solutions

Breaking down hypotheses into smaller, manageable parts before testing solutions proved far more effective. This approach allowed us to better identify what worked and what didn’t, avoiding inefficiencies from testing multiple aspects simultaneously.

### Involve Developers Early

Including developers in the process as early as possible saved significant time in the long run. While it required some upfront development time, their early involvement helped align technical feasibility with user needs and streamlined subsequent phases.

### Re-Prioritize Strategically

While re-prioritizing during development can be stressful, it is often a strategic choice that accelerates value delivery. Flexibility in adjusting priorities helped ensure that we focused on the most impactful elements at every stage.

### Manage Client and Team Expectations

Balancing client demands with the well-being of the development squad was critical. Ensuring the team did not feel overwhelmed by external pressure helped maintain a healthier, more productive working environment.
