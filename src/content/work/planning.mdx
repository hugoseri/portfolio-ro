# The product
Praxedo, created in 2005, is a comprehensive Field Resource Management solution designed to streamline the end-to-end workflow of service interventions. The platform empowers office teams to efficiently plan and assign technician jobs, while equipping field technicians with guided workflows, real-time updates, and mobile tools to ensure seamless service delivery. By bridging office operations and on-the-ground execution, Praxedo enhances operational efficiency, reduces response times, and improves customer satisfaction.

Our client base spanned multiple segments, with telecommunications emerging as the primary industry. Additionally, we served sectors like sanitation, among others. Given the solution’s versatility as a feature-rich, off-the-shelf product, our diverse client portfolio introduced a unique challenge: understanding and addressing the varying needs and workflows of different user groups across industries.

# The story

Through collaboration with sales and project managers, we uncovered a significant user pain point in team management. Specifically, Praxedo’s planning tool presents resources—both human and material—in a sorted list format. This structure makes it challenging to visualize which resources are collaborating together, leading to two major inefficiencies. First, planners spent considerable time organizing teams due to the lack of clear visualization. Second, managing urgent tasks became more difficult, as interpreting the planning layout required significant effort.

Identifying these pain points underscored the critical importance and potential impact of a new feature, especially for users in the sanitation industry. Recognizing this, we initiated a Discovery phase to gain deeper insights into user needs, prioritize them effectively, and develop targeted solutions.

# My role

In this initiative, my role was to lead the UX team by setting priorities and guiding the Discovery phase. This included conducting user interviews, observing users in their workplace, organizing insights, and identifying the most frequent and impactful needs. Based on these insights, I established key hypotheses to explore, paving the way for brainstorming potential solutions.

As the Discovery phase advanced, I brought developers and the UX team together to refine the proposed solution. I prepared comprehensive specifications for both the development team and clients, ensuring alignment and clarity. This phase required robust stakeholder management, involving internal teams (sales, project managers, UX, and the development squad) and external stakeholders (end users and client representatives).

During the development process, I managed the backlog, created detailed documentation, and defined success criteria to measure the feature's effectiveness once it was live. This approach ensured the feature stayed closely aligned with user needs and stakeholder expectations.

Additionally, as development progressed, I gathered feedback from identified user testers. This provided an opportunity to uncover more specific pain points and fine-tune the solution. By maintaining a continuous feedback loop between discovery and development, we ensured the feature consistently met user needs throughout the process.

# Results

Working on this feature brought significant improvements to the product, its market desirability, and the internal organization of our team.

### Product and Market Impact:
 
Introducing this feature opened new commercial opportunities, particularly with clients who had previously declined our solution due to a lack of visibility in team management. This enhancement was a decisive factor in securing contracts with three additional clients. Furthermore, the feature garnered widespread adoption, with more than 2,000 users identified as active adopters—representing over 75% of our target audience in the sanitation sector.

### Organizational Growth:

The development of this feature also drove valuable organizational improvements. Implementing a new technology (React) required the development team to adapt its workflows, including revising how user stories were structured and defining prerequisite technical tasks. Additionally, collaboration between project managers and product managers improved significantly, ensuring relevant information was effectively communicated.

These learnings led to the creation of enhanced documentation and communication practices, which proved efficient enough to be adopted across other projects, contributing to lasting organizational benefits.

# Challenges and learnings

Here are some key learnings we established during this initiative:

### Set Small Hypotheses Before Testing Solutions:

Breaking down hypotheses into smaller, manageable parts before testing solutions proved far more effective. This approach allowed us to better identify what worked and what didn’t, avoiding inefficiencies from testing multiple aspects simultaneously.

### Involve Developers Early:

Including developers in the process as early as possible saved significant time in the long run. While it required some upfront development time, their early involvement helped align technical feasibility with user needs and streamlined subsequent phases.

### Re-Prioritize Strategically:

While re-prioritizing during development can be stressful, it is often a strategic choice that accelerates value delivery. Flexibility in adjusting priorities helped ensure that we focused on the most impactful elements at every stage.

### Manage Client and Team Expectations:

Balancing client demands with the well-being of the development squad was critical. Ensuring the team did not feel overwhelmed by external pressure helped maintain a healthier, more productive working environment.
