# About Siemens Healthineers

Siemens Healthineers is a leading global provider of medical technology, specializing in diagnostic imaging, laboratory diagnostics, advanced therapies, and digital health solutions. Operating in over 70 countries, the company creates innovative tools such as MRI scanners and AI-powered platforms to enhance patient care, support precision medicine, and empower healthcare providers globally.

During my internship at the Open IT Studio, I contributed to an initiative dedicated to driving innovation in healthcare IT. The studio serves as a collaborative hub where internal teams, partners, and clients come together to design and develop advanced digital solutions tailored to the healthcare industry.

This initiative exemplifies Siemens Healthineers' dedication to advancing digital transformation in healthcare through technological expertise and user-centered innovation.

# The story
During my time at the Open IT Studio, I contributed to an exciting project aimed at improving IT security awareness among Siemens Healthineers’ employees. The challenge was significant: with the company operating across 70+ countries and the COVID-19 pandemic driving a sudden shift to remote work, traditional in-person security training was no longer viable.

To address this, we conceptualized a digital escape game—a fun, interactive way for employees to learn about cybersecurity. The game simulated real-world security scenarios, such as phishing attempts and malware threats, while encouraging teamwork and critical thinking. It was designed to be scalable and accessible, ensuring employees across the globe could engage with the content.

We faced several challenges during development:
* Ensuring the game balanced educational value with entertainment to make the learning experience impactful.
* Designing a multiplayer, collaborative experience to foster teamwork in a remote setting, maintaining a human connection often lost in virtual environments.

# My role
As an intern, I played a key role in shaping the first prototype of the digital escape game, focusing on research, design, and development:

1. Research & Ideation:

* Conducted research on common cybersecurity issues employees faced, including digital threats and physical office vulnerabilities.
* Brainstormed creative ways to present these scenarios in an engaging and interactive format.

2. Game Design:

* Collaborated with teammates to craft a compelling storyline and structure for the game, ensuring the challenges reflected real-world security risks.
* Focused on making the game collaborative, requiring participants to work together to solve puzzles and progress.

3. Development:

* Used Microsoft Power Platform to build the prototype, leveraging its flexible tools for creating game logic and user flows.
* Designed core gameplay mechanics and scenarios that introduced employees to key IT security concepts.

4. Testing & Refinement:

* Organized internal testing sessions with colleagues to gather feedback on the prototype.
* Iterated on the design based on user input, improving the game’s difficulty balance and user experience.

# The Outcome

While I worked primarily on the initial prototype, my contributions laid the foundation for the game’s development. The prototype established:

* A clear structure for translating complex IT security concepts into an engaging, interactive format.
* The core mechanics and storyline that guided further iterations by the team.
* A collaborative design approach that encouraged teamwork, even in a remote environment.

This experience helped me develop essential product management skills, including problem-solving, user-focused design, and rapid prototyping. It also taught me the importance of gathering user feedback early to shape and refine a product.

# Why This Matters

This project gave me firsthand experience in tackling real-world challenges with creativity and collaboration. By contributing to the prototype, I learned how to:
* Translate a broad business goal into actionable deliverables.
* Balance educational value with user engagement to create a meaningful experience.
* Use iterative development processes to improve a product’s design and functionality.
