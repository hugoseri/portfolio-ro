# About Siemens Healthineers

Siemens Healthineers is a leading global provider of medical technology, specializing in diagnostic imaging, laboratory diagnostics, advanced therapies, and digital health solutions. Operating in over 70 countries, the company creates innovative tools such as MRI scanners and AI-powered platforms to enhance patient care, support precision medicine, and empower healthcare providers globally.

During my internship at the Open IT Studio, I contributed to an initiative dedicated to driving innovation in healthcare IT. The studio serves as a collaborative hub where internal teams, partners, and clients come together to design and develop advanced digital solutions tailored to the healthcare industry.

This initiative exemplifies Siemens Healthineers' dedication to advancing digital transformation in healthcare through technological expertise and user-centered innovation.

# The story
During my time at the Open IT Studio, we faced the challenge of improving IT security awareness among Siemens Healthineers' employees, especially in the context of COVID-19. With the company spread across over 70 countries and the shift to remote work, traditional in-person training was no longer feasible. To address this, we developed the idea of a digital escape game to engage employees in learning about cybersecurity in a fun and interactive way. 

The game would simulate real-world security scenarios, allowing employees to identify risks like phishing and malware, while promoting teamwork and critical thinking. It provided a scalable, accessible solution to reach a global workforce, ensuring that employees stayed informed about IT security practices, even during the pandemic.

# My role
Together with the team, we began by compiling a diverse list of common security issues often overlooked by employees, which included both physical office space and digital practices. With this list in hand, we developed a storyline that would serve as the foundation for our escape game. 

We then selected Microsoft Power Platform as the technology for the game, as it was a tool we were familiar with and offered a wide range of design possibilities. I collaborated with fellow interns to design the game and develop its logic using the platform's features. 

After creating the initial version, we brought in testers to gather feedback on the game's difficulty and overall user experience. Based on their input, we made adjustments and fine-tuned the game to ensure it was both engaging and effective in raising awareness about security issues.
