# The story
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
During my time at the Open IT Studio, we faced the challenge of improving IT security awareness among Siemens Healthineers' employees, especially in the context of COVID-19. With the company spread across over 70 countries and the shift to remote work, traditional in-person training was no longer feasible. To address this, we developed the idea of a digital escape game to engage employees in learning about cybersecurity in a fun and interactive way. 
<br/>
<br/>
The game would simulate real-world security scenarios, allowing employees to identify risks like phishing and malware, while promoting teamwork and critical thinking. It provided a scalable, accessible solution to reach a global workforce, ensuring that employees stayed informed about IT security practices, even during the pandemic.

# My role
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Together with the team, we began by compiling a diverse list of common security issues often overlooked by employees, which included both physical office space and digital practices. With this list in hand, we developed a storyline that would serve as the foundation for our escape game. 
<br/>
<br/>
We then selected Microsoft Power Platform as the technology for the game, as it was a tool we were familiar with and offered a wide range of design possibilities. I collaborated with fellow interns to design the game and develop its logic using the platform's features. 
<br/>
<br/>
After creating the initial version, we brought in testers to gather feedback on the game's difficulty and overall user experience. Based on their input, we made adjustments and fine-tuned the game to ensure it was both engaging and effective in raising awareness about security issues.
