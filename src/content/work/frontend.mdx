# Techno

Given that Praxedo Web was built on an older technology stack, a key challenge was modernizing the platform to ensure better performance, scalability, and usability. The migration of the front-end to React not only upgraded the underlying technology but also provided an excellent opportunity to significantly enhance the design and user experience of the entire web application.

# The story

When I joined, the platform was a 15-year-old legacy product with outdated technologies, creating significant user and business challenges. With no dedicated UX team and no behavioral data, user confusion was common, and product decisions lacked data-driven insights.

The platform's outdated YUI front-end limited scalability and developer efficiency. While migrating to React was necessary, it couldn’t resolve user experience issues. A comprehensive design system was needed to unify the platform’s look, improve usability, and guide both developers and designers.

These challenges presented an opportunity to not only modernize the platform but also create a more user-focused and efficient product development culture. My mission was to lead this transformation—bridging the gap between development and UX while driving technical and process improvements to align with the company’s long-term goals.

# My role
As the product manager, I led the migration from YUI to React, ensuring a cohesive, user-focused experience. I drove technical leadership, fostered cross-team collaboration, and improved processes.

## Key responsibilities:

* **Driving Cross-Functional Collaboration:**

Collaborated with developers and UX designers to integrate React migration with a new design system, resolving UI inconsistencies and improving both scalability and usability.

* **Feedback Collection and Iteration:**

Collected feedback from developers, UX designers, and users throughout the migration process, refining workflows and the design system to meet team and user requirements.

* **Establishing Efficient Processes:**

Introduced shared workflows and communication channels between UX and development teams, enabling faster iterations and consistent execution.
Documented and shared best practices to ensure smooth collaboration and maintain high-quality standards across teams.

* **Advocating for UX Integration:**

Championed UX as a core part of the product development process, helping teams understand its value in driving better user outcomes.
Organized regular retrospectives and feedback loops to foster continuous improvement and alignment.

# Challenges and learnings

## Aligning teams amid change

### Challenge

The introduction of a UX role within the company brought significant challenges, as there were no established processes or collaboration norms between the UX and development teams. This disconnect created misalignment on goals, requirements, and expectations.

### Solution

* Clarified the role of UX and its value to the development team, ensuring alignment on how UX supports both product development and user satisfaction.
* Organized regular retrospectives involving both teams to identify gaps, share feedback, and refine collaboration practices.
* Introduced shared workflows like joint design reviews and feedback loops to ensure consistent alignment between UX and development.

### Outcome

These changes bridged the gap between UX and development, improving collaboration and enhancing the product quality and workflow.

### Learning

Recognizing the need for change is only the first step; ensuring others understand and align with your vision requires continuous communication, active listening, and openness. Success lies in fostering a shared understanding and creating alignment across all stakeholders.

## Ensuring UX Precision

### Challenge

Developers were unfamiliar with detailed design specifications, leading to inconsistencies between the design and final product, which frustrated teams and impacted the user experience.

### Solution

* Established a new QA process incorporating a UX review step, ensuring designs were implemented accurately and potential issues were caught early in the process.
* Fostered direct communication between developers and UX designers, allowing for immediate resolution of discrepancies and preventing delays.

### Outcome

The new QA process reduced errors, improved design consistency, and sped up development cycles.

### Learning
Alignment across multiple development squads is particularly challenging, as each team has its own processes, preferences, and habits. Achieving this requires open, two-way communication to ensure that processes implemented in one team can scale effectively across others. The goal is to maintain flexibility for individual teams while still upholding consistent delivery quality.

## Ensuring Cross-Team Alignment During the Migration

### Challenge

The React migration and new design system required alignment across multiple dev squads, but the lack of centralized communication led to confusion and delays.

### Solution

* Centralized updates on the migration’s progress and provided teams with clear timelines and expectations.
* Documented and shared best practices for adopting new processes and technologies, ensuring consistency across teams.
* Actively collected feedback from teams to identify and address pain points early.

### Outcome

Improved communication and clear documentation resulted in smoother transitions, reduced disruptions, and better collaboration across teams.

# Conclusion

Leading the front-end migration from YUI to React and implementing a new design system was a transformative journey for both the platform and the teams involved. By prioritizing cross-functional collaboration, streamlining processes, and integrating UX at every step, we not only modernized the platform but also fostered a culture of continuous improvement and alignment across development and design teams.

The success of the migration and design system implementation resulted in a more user-friendly, scalable product. The improved workflows, enhanced communication, and stronger collaboration between teams have significantly contributed to the product's ongoing quality and development.

This experience highlighted the importance of clear communication, structured processes, and cross-team collaboration in driving large-scale transformations. As a product manager, this project has deepened my ability to lead large-scale transformations, bringing together diverse teams to achieve ambitious technical and user-focused goals.
