Hi there!

I’m a product manager with 3 years of experience shaping B2B SaaS solutions in the Field Service Management industry. I’ve led impactful projects, from modernizing front-end interfaces to launching features that make users’ daily tasks simpler and more efficient.

With a background in engineering and a master’s in management, I combine technical foundation with strategic thinking to create intuitive, user-first products. I believe user satisfaction drives business success, and I rely on data and metrics to prioritize effectively and deliver meaningful results.

I thrive on collaborating with cross-functional teams, and I’m always eager to learn, explore new industries, and discover innovative products. My goal? To grow, have fun, and build solutions that make a difference.
